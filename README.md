# WebRTC-project
Created a video calling application using React and WebRTC


To use :  
1.First clone in local system then install the node_modules in server and client <br>
2.Open localhost 3000 in two different windows and enter respective emails and same room id <br>
3.When you will enter room in 2nd window , 1st window will show call button click on that <br>
4.Now you will see a local stream of your own system under My Stream title and in 2nd window along with My Stream a Remote Stream title will be shown now click on Send Stream button in this 2nd window <br>
5.Peer to peer vid calling is established now it will continue even if you stop your server as webRTC is doesnt need a server.
